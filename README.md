# Linked List Tasks

This repository contains my **Linked List practice tasks** implemented in **C++**.

---

## 📚 Tasks Included

### 1. Singly Linked List
- Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.
- Supports basic operations:
  - Insertion at beginning, middle, and end.
  - Deletion of nodes.
  - Traversal and searching.

### 2. Doubly Linked List
- Each node has links to both previous and next nodes.
- Allows two-way traversal.
- Supports insertion and deletion at any position.

### 3. Circular Linked List
- The last node connects back to the first node.
- Can be singly or doubly circular.
- Supports insertion and deletion in a circular way.
